# Conclusion and further research

This study has provided some background on continuous delivery in the context of microservices; gotten an understanding of what the industry sees as important in a strategy for continuously delivering microservices; completed a development project to improve these criteria; and finally, established a set of distinct criteria for evaluating and comparing these strategies.

## Contributions

The literature review and interviews have shown that there is a clear gap between the literature and practitioners in the field of continuously delivering microservices. In particular, the literature focuses mainly on quantitative measurements of strategies such as the number of steps required to change the configuration. On the other hand, the interviews showed that more general qualities are important to the industry, such as whether the strategy will increase the testability of the system.

The interviews provide an insight into what practitioners consider to be important qualities in a deployment strategy for microservices. This part of the study sheds light on the differences between the literature and the industry, and provide some pointers to areas of further research.

This study's primary research contribution is the evaluation and comparison framework, which is comprised of the set of characteristics mapped to units. The framework is designed to be modifiable: a user of the framework may freely add, change, or remove characteristics to make the framework better suited to their context.

## Future work

This study has answered its research questions. However, there are many aspects of continuously deploying microservices that have not been considered. In particular, the organisational impact of introducing Continuous Delivery in a microservice is a highly relevant object of study.

This study has grounded and presented a foundation for building a framework tailored to the interests of the organisation and project at hand. The advent of container-based deployments has not been considered in detail, and should definitely be a subject of study in the future.

The interviews only provided a single point of insight into the state of the art in Continuous Delivery of microservices. This effort is led by the industry, and so further case studies, engaged scholarships, and other projects to identify and explain the efforts will be valuable contributions to the literature.

There is an abundance of ways to implement continuous delivery, which is only added to by the introduction of microservices. The contexts of each project, system, team, and organisation will always be unique, although this study has presented an attempt at generalising them. There is, then, no perfect way of providing a single framework that will fit all needs. This framework attempts to compensate for this inconsistency by being modifiable and extensible by design. Nonetheless, further work must be completed to fill the gap in the current literature between continuous delivery and a microservice environment.
